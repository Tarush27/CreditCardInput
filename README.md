# CreditCardInput
This app is used to check whether the user has correctly 
entered the important details like card number, cvv,
expiry date, first and last name.
If all these are correct a dialog box will appear for 
confirming and displaying  successful payment
otherwise if any of the details are incorrect, 
then dialog box won't appear.
This app is created for best UI practices in android 
which plays a vital role in android development.
Also, this app uses view model which handles
all the business logic and activity makes use
of view model to update UI.
Also, I learnt practical implementation of 
OOPS in kotlin like conditional statements
such as If else, all kinds of operators,
use of functions, I have added suitable comments
to the code for additional information.
Also, it supports both light and dark mode.
